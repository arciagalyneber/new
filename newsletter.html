				<p> 1. BE A PLANNER
				You can’t plan for everything, but don’t let your Monday mornings catch you off-guard.
				Just like you’d plan a week’s worth of meals on a Sunday if you’re trying to stay trim,
				plan your outfits in advance for stress-free mornings and outfit-regret-free days.
				2. FOLLOW STYLISH WOMEN
				Browse internet trendsetters in your free time. 
				Find a few fashionistas whose style you admire, 
				then use their photos as inspiration to create da
				3.DRESS FOR THE OCCASION
				If you’re ever on the fence about what to wear,
				consider where you’re going and who you’ll see.
				When in doubt, always err on the side of being too dressy—it’s a big no-no to be the only person in jeans.
				ily looks.4. ROCK RED LIPSTICK
				A well-known fashion “it-girl” hack: swipe on a touch of bright, 
				cherry-red lipstick in a tone that best suits your skin. It’s an instant face brightener that screams “I took time for myself”—even if you didn’t.
				5. ALWAYS ACCESSORIZE
				Try to have at least one accessory on,
				whether it’s a statement necklace,
				a pop-color scarf or an great pair of earrings.
				And remember: sometimes less is more.
				You don’t need to get crazy at an arm party—minimal can also be memorable.
				6. INVEST IN BASICS THAT FIT
				Basics really aren’t basic—they can be the foundation of extremely fashionable (and simple!) choices.
				Ever wonder why a woman looks great in a white button-up, 
				skinny jeans and heels? It took a minute to think of the look,
				but it took planning to ensure her pieces fit perfectly.
				7.WEAR COLORFUL SHOES
				When it comes to footwear, color packs a huge style punch—and they don’t have to be sky-high heels,
				either (flats can make the same statement and your feet will thank you).
				Next time you’re in jeans and a tee, throw on cobalt or fuschia flats to make your outfit go from 0 to 100 instantly.
				8. OWN ONE CONVERSATION PIECE
				Every once in a while, you need that pure “wow” factor. 
				Whether it’s an amazing pair of over-the-knee boots,
				a vintage dress that you borrowed from you mom’s closet or an enviable handbag,
				keep something in your arsenal for the days you need to really show up stylish.
				9. CARRY A FASHION EMERGENCY KIT
				The most stylish women are always prepared. 
				Whether it’s a snag, stain or sandal-induced blister,
				be on your toes with a 911 carryall chock-full of band-aids, 
				sewing kit and other essentials to (stylishly) save the day.
				10. SELECT THE RIGHT UNDERGARMENTS
				Stylish women know the foundation (hehe, literally) of a great look is appropriate underwear. 
				Besides, nothing instantly throws off a look like VPL (visible panty lines).
				Be strategic about what you slip on and why—then do a quick mirror scan in natural light before you leave the house.</p>

				<p>Fashion trends come and go: meanwhile a society's values are established and
				and evolving characteristic to their beliefs and culture.Fashion is just not an
				ambitious projected image of a reinterpreted good oid value to fullfil some function or agenda alike but rather
				a evocation and refreshing concept worthy enough to be portrayed for society's
